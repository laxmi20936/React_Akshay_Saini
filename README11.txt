 Context API
 
HOC - HOC is component which takes in a component and returns a component.
Hoc takes in a component and enhances(adds extra features) that component and then 
returns the new component.

Hoc is a pure function which is taking a function and not modifing that function but 
adding some feature on top of it.
meaning- ResCard is not modified but label is added on top of it.
